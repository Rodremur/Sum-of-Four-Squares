You will be given an integer n, and you will have to express as summation of four square-numbers.
For example 30 can be written as summation of four squares in the following way:
30 = 4 * 4 + 3 * 3 + 2 * 2 + 1 * 1

If a number can be expressed as summation of four squares in more than one ways, any one of them
will do. A square is a number whose square root is also an integer.

Input
Input starts with an integer T (≤ 120000), denoting the number of test cases. Each case contains an
integer n (0 ≤ n < 1017) in a line.

Note: As the size of the input file is large, so use faster I/O functions like scanf(), printf().

Output
For each case, print a line containing four integer numbers a, b, c, d such that
n = a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2

If the number cannot be expressed as summation of four squares then you should print ‘Impossible.’
instead.

Sample Input
3
30
2
0

Sample Output
5 2 0 1
1 0 0 1
0 0 0 0

/*Example of the program running*/
2			//Number of Test Cases
30			//n number which we want to obtain with the four square sum
5 2 1 0			//Result
65			//n number which we want to obtain with the four square sum
8 1 0 0			//Result
